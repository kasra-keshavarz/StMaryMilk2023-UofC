# Introduction
In this directory, the `ID`s of polygons provided through the geofabric by the `PRMS` model for the St. Mary and Milk river systems to that of [`TGF`](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjOrPHrg_v_AhUgGDQIHf6CC2gQFnoECCEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencebase.gov%2Fcatalog%2Fitem%2F5d967365e4b0c4f70d113923&usg=AOvVaw2rY7Vy2R8EAz3WHe0HSmmS&opi=89978449) dataset is mapped and available for correspondence. The `PRMS` model has been shared by [Kathy Chase](kchase@usgs.gov) in the form of a zipped file `20230605_gm_byHWobs_st_mary_and_milk_rivers.zip` on June 5th, 2023, with the Climate and Hydrology (C&H) Technical Working Group (TWG). Based on the files included in the shared model, it has been prepared by the USGS's `bandit` program to subset the St. Mary and Milk systems from the bigger `NHM` setup.
