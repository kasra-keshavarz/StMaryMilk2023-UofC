# DNRC gauges used
This directory contains the [information table](./dnrc-usgs-gauges-calibration-table.csv) in the `.csv` format, detailing necessary information on the employed `DNRC` gauges used in the calibration process of the `HYPE` hydrological model. The information includes DNRC gauges' names, their equivalent USGS IDs and code names, and their geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and logitude).

This table has been created by [Paul Coderre](paul.coderre@ucalgary.ca).
