# ESRI Shapefile of the DNRC gauges
An ESRI Shapefile of employed DNRC gauges in the calibration process of the `HYPE` hydrological model have been created based on the [dnrc-usgs-gauges-calibration-table.csv](../dnrc-usgs-gauges-calibration-table/dnrc-usgs-gauges-calibration-table.csv) table. Since the generation of this ESRI Shapefile is a trivial processs, the relevant workflow has been omitted from this repository. 

The generated ESRI Shapefile of DNRC gauges which are employed in the calibration process of the `HYPE` model is locate here.
