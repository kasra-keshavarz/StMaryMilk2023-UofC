# St. Mary & Milk River Basins Study - IJC
Univesrity of Calgary's repository for the St. Marty and Milk River Basins as part of the IJC's 2023 study.

# Geofabric Datasets
As of April 2023, only four Geospatial fabric datasets for the St. Mary & Milk River Basins (SMM) have been chosen as candidates to be used in the study. In this repository, these geofabrics are analyzed and their comptatibility with various hydrological/land-surface modelling platforms (developed/used within the Global Water Futures program, GWF) is assessed. The chosen datasets are as following:
1. TGF, Transboundary Geospatial Fabric Dataset Subset for the SMM Area ([DOI 10.5066/P971JAGF](https://doi.org/10.5066/P971JAGF))
2. HUC12 Geofabric Dataset Subset for the SMM Area (Retrieved from ECCC, [Jamie Kolodinsky](mailto:Jamie.Kolodinsky@ec.gc.ca))
3. MERIT-Basins Geofabric Dataset Subset for the SMM Area ([DOI 10.1029/2019WR025287](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025287))
4. PFRA Geofabric Subset for the SMM Area (Retrieved from [Canada Open Data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c20d97e7-60d8-4df8-8611-4d499a796493))

# Analysis
## Non-contributing Areas of Geofabric Datasets
The non-contributing areas of each geofabric dataset is analyzed in the [non-contributing_areas](./non-contributing_areas) directory of this repository.

## Comptaibility of Geofabric Datasets with GWF's Hydrological/Landsurface Modelling Workflows
The comptatibility of each geofabric dataset is analyzed in the [compatibility](./compatibility) directory of this repository.
